			<p><i>Rebirth</i> by Maryam Farghaly is a multimedia motion graphic work that explores “a circle of life” through photography, videography, and animation. In <i>Rebirth</i>, every individual’s fate upon birth is to experience a course of events before meeting their death. This surreal video begins with an individual before the start of their life, in a state dubbed as “the void.” Presented with a participation number, the individual is asked by “the void” whether or not they would like to proceed with the start of their life and get transported to Earth. When the individual requests to see a preview of their coming life, the following scenes depict their imminent reality—the individual rapidly undergoes the progression of time and age within their lifetime, witnessing distinct experiences associated with each stage of life. Typical scenes such as children playing with toys, teenagers immersed in technology, and a woman entering into motherhood are portrayals of a conventional life, such as is often assumed by society or popularized within the media. With the inclusion of thought-provoking questions in each stage of life, Farghaly prompts the audience to challenge the question of life’s purpose, and the seemingly preordained nature of events within one’s life. Rather than presenting a dream-like alternate reality, Farghaly’s depiction of a reality very much like our own is a sobering existential provocation to viewers.</p>
