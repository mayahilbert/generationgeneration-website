			<p>Do people born in the same era share a similar mindset? Carol Castillo’s video <i>Success X Failure</i> explores people’s definitions of success and failure to see if generations share sets of values. Castillo conducted a survey asking the public what success and failure are to them. <i>Success X Failure</i> aims to understand and find similarities and differences among perspectives from different generations. 

</p>
<p>The video displays four frames collaged from images that epitomize an era associated with a certain generation: Generation Z, Generation Y, Generation X, and Baby Boomers. The frames are populated by animated text that presents a single survey response. Castillo invites the audience to guess the generation of the survey participant who shared that response before the video reveals which era the person grew up in. The audience must pay close attention to the frames to understand the era being represented. The video plays in two segments, one focused on responses about success and the other on responses concerning failure. The survey will remain open during the exhibition and can be accessed through the Generation, Generation capstone exhibition website. Everyone is invited to express their personal definitions of success and failure—there is no right or wrong answer.
