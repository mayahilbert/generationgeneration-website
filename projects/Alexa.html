			<p><i>Poderosas</i> by Alexa Eusebio is a digital photography series in which vibrantly colored silhouettes of women depict the revolutionized significance of LatinX rights. “Poderosas” in Spanish translates to “empowered women” in English. The project reveals the progress and evolution of LatinX women across generations. 
</p>
			<p>
				<i>Poderosas</i> is divided into two overarching themes, power and uniqueness, each is represented by vibrant colors. In pink, red, and blue tones, power portrays the political, social, and financial stability women have conquered in areas they once had no access to. In these images, women using their hands and mouths to voice their power and dominance. Power also signifies LatinX women’s best qualities and traits such as nurturance, supportiveness, and humility. Green and yellow tones convey embracing uniqueness, as women admire their divine characteristics, traits, and physical features such as hair texture, skin tones, body shapes, and sizes. 
</p>
<p>These two overarching themes, power and uniqueness, identify what Eusebio views as the strongest areas of growth for LatinX women. <i>Poderosas</i> transforms oppressive and sexist histories into occasions for happiness about the freedom and independence women have gained over the past decades. <i>Poderosas</i> aims to redefine what it means to be a LatinX woman in our generation.
