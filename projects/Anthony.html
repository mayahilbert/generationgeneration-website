			<p>It can be frustrating to be so different from the people closest to you. Different folks were raised in different atmospheres, cultures, and eras, and their mindsets vary accordingly. <i>The Worst of Both Worlds</i>, a video by Anthony Chung, explores such differences between generations. Chung portrays differences in interests such as music, video games, and ways of communicating. The last—the language folks use to communicate with their friends and family—may be one of the most profound moments of differentiation between one generation and another. Miscommunications abound in <i>The Worst of Both Worlds</i>, as Chung uses slang to reveal generational affiliation. He brings humor to bear on frustrating situations, including portraying how a younger generation can tend to be lazier compared to their parents’ generation. Many people will relate to the insights and situations in The Worst of Both Worlds, such as parents’ not understanding their children and vice versa. Popular expressions change with time and sometimes come back in future generations. Generations can be different, can have difficulties understanding one another, and yet can come to an understanding of sorts.
