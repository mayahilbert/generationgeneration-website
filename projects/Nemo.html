			<p><i>Everyday Automation</i> by Nehemiah Lucena is a video that portrays contemporary life with and without the use of automation. All throughout our lives, technology and automation have become more advanced with the intention of making our lives a little easier. Lucena tackles this topic by showcasing differences in everyday tasks, inviting viewers to reflect on how technology has become a part of our daily routines and has often made life easier. Portraying simple acts such as walking versus using an escalator, or fanning oneself with paper versus using a fan or air conditioning, <i>Everyday Automation</i> shows how small moments of automation have become factors in almost everyone’s lives. Demonstrating the differences between life with and without technology highlights how far humanity has come and invites the question of how far it will go. Many people rely on automated devices such as the ones depicted in Lucena’s video, even though people in the past were able to function perfectly well without them. This leaves room for the question of what life in the future will be like. What new technological advancements will arise?
