			<p>Trends may come and go, but they always return. Eunice Cho’s <i>I was born in the wrong generation</i> focuses on how fashion is coming full circle in the current Gen Z and Millennial obsession with Y2K fashion. As technology advances, people begin to “miss” old things they may never have experienced firsthand and try to relive those prior moments. Y2K is a fashion statement created by millennials that highlights emotional items from high-teen stars in the 2000s with bold accessories, colorful pattern combinations, low-rise pants, and more. </p>
			<p>
				Cho presents Y2K fashion trends through physical magazine spreads that showcase Y2K fashion, giving a sense of the past. Each page displays nostalgic items and descriptions. For example, in one spread, viewers can create their own outfits by selecting which clothing they wish to wear. </p>
				<p>Cho explains how social trends are becoming more popular as more accessible technology—such as social media platforms like Tiktok—facilitates the circulation of trends. A fashion statement could spread to millions of people, who would then make it even more popular. Overall, fashion is 
cyclical, and while a style may not be for everyone, it will eventually find its way back into the closets of future generations. Y2K is an example of this. It represents a simpler time in history that many people long for today.
