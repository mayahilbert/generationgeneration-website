			<p>In the short video <i>Wonders of My Mind</i>, Mishel Agustin uses old childhood photographs to display her life’s progress while acknowledging the internal struggles she met with in the processof blossoming into the woman she is today. As the saying goes, “a picture is worth a thousand words,” which is what Agustin tries to convey in this work. The artist chose to showcase photographs and videos from the earliest years of her life, spanning ages one to four. These artifacts recreate childhood events that she cannot remember. At face value, they depict a girl who is slowly developing physically over the years, surrounded by her family and friends. In the final scenes of her video, the artist uses recent photographs of herself to indicate a sense of progress. 
</p>
<p>Agustin’s inspiration for the project originated in reorganizing her room, which sparked self-reflection. She considered moments in her life that left an impression on her and affected where she stands today. In <i>Wonders of My Mind</i> Agustin shows the people in her life that left a mark on her, while leaving one to wonder what might have been different about these photographs had the artist not endured these impressionable moments in her life. </p>
