			<p>In the video work <i>Living for Granted</i>, Stanley Yashayev uses two clips to suggest the simplicity of his life: a short scene of him using a computer followed by a clip of him lying in bed to go to sleep. These visuals not only portray his own life, but also pertain to many others in his generation (Generation Z). 
</p>
			<p>
				Strikingly, Yashayev’s mundane visuals are accompanied by a dramatic story, conveyed through an audio recording of the artist’s great grandfather telling his life story in Russian recorded shortly before his death. Taken together, the audio and the visuals compare Yashayev’s generation’s and his great-grandfather’s generation's lives. What we see of Yashayev’s life contrasts sharply with what we hear of his great-grandfather’s experiences. We come to understand that his great-grandfather’s past sacrifices enabled Yashayev’s present-day comfort.
</p>
<p> Many people prioritize the legacy of a happy, successful family; they want their children to do the same for their own children and so on, so that their progeny thrives for posterity. Those in stable living conditions may never think about the hardships that previous generations in their family faced to give them a content life, which is why people should be appreciative and stop living life for granted.
