			<p>Sophie Ryan’s video <i>The Wheels</i> represents constant cycles both in life and in the development of technologies. The capitalistic mindset of “grinding” and “pushing yourself” inspires this piece. As rapid edits build momentum, a recognizable lifestyle pattern is revealed. Multiple clips placed back-to-back create repetition, evoking a dreadful feeling that many associate with 9-to-5 lifestyles. Reinforcing this compulsive pattern, Ryan inserts clips showing technology in use. For example, <i>The Wheels</i> begins with someone waking up and immediately going on their phone. Various clips depict a younger generation that is overly invested in technology and social media. Evoking “the grind,” Ryan recreates the journey of a commuter. We see a few people coming out of a building, then a scene of a train passing, followed by the street view from inside the train. In between these clips, Ryan introduces the audience to a young couple experiencing some of the emotional ups and downs people face throughout a day. As Ryan continues to build tension in her video, the first character goes to bed, and the same day replays over again at a very fast speed. Ryan is guided by her feelings and intuition in creating most of her work, and in <i>The Wheels</i>, she has incorporated technologies ranging from a typewriter to an iPhone. Ryan’s choice of media captures the essence of her generation as well as the development of technology, resulting in a video that resonates emotionally while offering a technological critique.</p>
