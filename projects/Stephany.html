			<p>Stephany Canela’s <i>Boroughs Truth</i> is an interactive artwork concerning the gentrification of New York City’s boroughs. The interactive <i>Boroughs Truth</i> website allows viewers to develop conversations with one another about gentrification, including their observations, opinions, community histories, and more. Viewers can navigate the gentrification of the Bronx, Harlem, Brooklyn, and Queens. The website features Canela’s original photographs that show or imply gentrification, such as a tree that fell out of its stump, buildings, graffiti, and people walking. 

</p>
<p><i>Boroughs Truth</i> offers an essential platform for communities to speak about topics like gentrification. This project relates to the Generation, Generation exhibition theme because gentrification has affected many generations of people who reside in these areas. Families in New York City’s boroughs have a deep-rooted appreciation for the places that are their homes. <i>Boroughs Truth</i> questions whether gentrification is unfair for generational residents of different neighborhoods. Not only does it affect many communities, but it directly affects Canela herself. Gentrification is moving into her community with the construction of luxurious buildings, creating a massive disconnect with the people currently living there. Canela believes that using one’s voice and collaborating with others is the first step to change; that is precisely what Boroughs Truth does.
